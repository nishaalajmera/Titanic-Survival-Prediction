# Titanic Survival Prediction
In 1912, the RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. This resulted in an unfortunate death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew due to lack of lifeboats for everyone onboard. It was observed from the passenger data that some group of people were more likely to survive than others. 
In this analysis we aim to investigate the survival chances of passengers from different demographics and groups. Machine learning models will be used to assess and predict passenger survival. The features of the data will also be assessed to understand which features were more important to give a good prediction of survival. 
The best machine learning model that was found to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic is Random Forest with the number of trees specified as 100 and maximum depth of 5 for each tree. It is shown that the top 4 important features that influences that survival chances is the Sex of the passenger, Title of the person,the passenger class (Pclass) and the ticket fare paid by passenger (Fare).
